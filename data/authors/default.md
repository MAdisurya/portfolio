I'm a versatile web developer with the expertise and experience to be able to make a positive contribution in any web project across an entire stack (frontend, backend, infrastructure, devops).

I believe that technologies role in society is to enable and unlock things that people weren't able to do before, such as streamlining and automating certain manual processes or making data collection and visualisation more accessible.
So I naturally gravitate towards the type of work which involves building software which does this due to the impact it can make to society.
More specifically, I'm currently interested in industries such as EdTech and IoT.

Other than Software Engineering, listening to tech podcasts, or reading articles, I like to spend my time in the ocean catching some swell on my surfboard (or my SUP on smaller days). Yew! ü§ô

My role consisted mostly of individual contributor tasks such as feature development and paying down technical debt, as well as supporting and mentoring more junior engineers.

My most notable work includes streamlining the CGA tech teams kanban process to ensure better collaboration between product and engineering, and feature leading a complex data integration project that required re-designing, implementing and migrating to a new database schema model.

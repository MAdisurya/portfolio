During my tenure at Genesis Energy, I worked on their flagship Energy IQ application which provided self service capabilities for their customers.

Most notably, I was instrumental to Energy IQ's modern cloud and Infrastructure-as-Code migration, helping them escape "researching themselves into paralysis".
I contributed to the technical design, scoped out the work required for the migration, and successfully setup and implemented a functional MVP of the migration--putting the team in a strong position to deliver after I had left.

I was also intrumental in improving the development teams writing culture by introducing the request for comments (RFC) document for communicating substantial changes and the postmortem document for facilitating meaningful post-incident retrospectives.
